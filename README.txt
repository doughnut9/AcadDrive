Hi, just a quick note.

Courses in sem 1 and sem 2 can be different for you please check your courses in Quanta. The lecture PDFs which I have may be different
from those students who had a different set of courses in sem 1 and 2. Though it does not matter much which ones you use since the
content is same and mostly regulated.
